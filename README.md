# Jonâ€™s dotfiles

Homebase for my dev settings.

## Installation

### Step 1: prepare Mac OS X

1. Install Xcode from the App Store
2. Open Xcode's preferences and install the command line tools package (this will also install Git) (on OS X Mavericks you need to run `xcode-select --install` instead)

### Step 2: clone and install dotfiles

*Work in progress.*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonchretien/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh
```
### Step 3: apply themes and misc. settings

* [Emmet](http://emmet.io/download/)
* [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation)
* [Soda Sublime Theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/)
* [Solarized Limechat Theme](https://github.com/paulcpederson/solarized-limechat)
